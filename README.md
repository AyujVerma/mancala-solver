# mancala-solver
A solver for Game Pigeon's Mancala. The solver can play both the avalanche and capture modes.
The solver uses recursive backtracking to tell the user what move is the best at this moment in time (a greedy algorithm).
The solver allows the user to input the opponent's moves, so the user does not need to exit the program after every move.
